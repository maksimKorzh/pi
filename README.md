# PI
Terminal based text editor written in Python & Curses<br>

# Features
    PI uses a micro kernel architecture, editor's source takes
    less than a 100 lines of code but it can be extended via
    binding custom python scripts to certain key strokes or
    just like plugins that can be invoked from command prompt.
    PI provides a built in Python shell where you can write
    one liners to manipulate editor's state by altering it's
    global variables.
